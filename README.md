# FUNDS: Functional Utilities and Data Structures


This package provides a collection of tools for functional programming. They are
all strongly typed for easy consumption from TypeScript.

The package contains a set of ES6 modules, so you will most likely need a
preprocessor and polyfills if you intend to use it in a browser.
